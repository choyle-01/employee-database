# employee-database
      
## Description

In this assignment we were tasked with writing out an application that propts a user through a command prompt to view or change database data. The application should use mysql to create and view databases based on what the user selects in the terminal. The user is given the options to view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee role. When the user selects to view all departments a table showing all the departments is displayed. When the user chooses to view all roles a table showing all the departments is displayed. When all employees are viewed then a table showing all employees and employee data is presented. The user can also choose to add a department and prompt for the name of the department. They are also able to add an employee and role in the same manner. They are also able to update an employee's role. All information is saved and updated in the database.
